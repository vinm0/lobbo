## Introduction

Lobbo is a lobby-style, social networking webapp. The goal of Lobbo is to help leaders organize a space for collaboration.

_Leaders_ could build lobbies to work on a common project, organize an event, or plan a game night. Just start a new lobby, invite _colleagues_ to join, and move your goals forward.

### **Philosophy**

Lobbo's philosophy is that everyone is has the capacity for leadership. We all have a vision for how the world can be different than it is right now. Lobbo allows people to build lobbies and shape the world into one where their goals are fulfilled. For that reason, all Lobbo users are known as _Leaders_.

A Lobbo Leader can create lobbies and can contribute to lobbies of other Leaders as _Colleagues_. Colleagues are Leaders who reside in the same network. Colleagues can be members of the same lobby or share Colleagues with other Colleagues.
